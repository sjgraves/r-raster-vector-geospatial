In this episode, we will introduce the fundamental principles, packages and
metadata/raster attributes that are needed to work with raster data in R. We will
discuss some of the core metadata elements that we need to understand to work with
rasters in R, including CRS and resolution. We will also explore missing and bad
data values as stored in a raster and how R handles these elements.

We will continue to work with the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages that were introduced
in the [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) lesson. We will use two additional packages in this episode to work with raster data - the
`raster` and `rgdal` packages. Make sure that you have these packages loaded.

##The Data

In this lesson, we will be working with two field sites: the Harvard Forest (`HARV`) and San Joaquin Experimental Range (`SJER`).

In this lesson, the raster we will use is: `HARV_dsmCrop.tif`.

For the challenges in this lesson, we will use both and `HARV_dsmCrop.tif` and `HARV_DSMhill.tif`.



## View Raster File Attributes

We will be working with a series of GeoTIFF files in this lesson. The
GeoTIFF format contains a set of embedded tags with metadata about the raster
data. We can use the function `GDALinfo()` to get information about our raster
data before we read that data into R. It is ideal to do this before importing
your data.

Each line of text that was printed to the console is now stored as an element of
the character vector `HARV_dsmCrop_info`. We will be exploring this data throughout this
episode. By the end of this episode, you will be able to explain and understand the output above.

## Open a Raster in R

Now that we've previewed the metadata for our GeoTIFF, let's import this
raster dataset into R and explore its metadata more closely. We can use the `raster()`
function to open a raster in R.



First we will load our raster file into R and view the data structure.


~~~
DSM_HARV <- raster("data/raster/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

DSM_HARV
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
class      : RasterLayer 
dimensions : 898, 1078, 968044  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)
extent     : 731453, 732531, 4712472, 4713370  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
crs        : +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
source     : /home/travis/build/UW-Madison-DataScience/r-raster-vector-geospatial/_episodes_rmd/data/raster/HARV_dsmCrop.tif 
names      : HARV_dsmCrop 
values     : 330.9, 405.15  (min, max)
~~~
{: .output}

The information above includes a report of min and max values, but no other data
range statistics. Similar to other R data structures like vectors and data frame
columns, descriptive statistics for raster data can be retrieved like


~~~
summary(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in .local(object, ...): summary is an estimate based on a sample of 1e+05 cells (10.33% of all cells)
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
        HARV_dsmCrop
Min.          331.26
1st Qu.       361.58
Median        372.58
3rd Qu.       380.94
Max.          404.10
NA's            0.00
~~~
{: .output}

but note the warning - unless you force R to calculate these statistics using
every cell in the raster, it will take a random sample of 100,000 cells and
calculate from that instead. To force calculation on more, or even all values,
you can use the parameter `maxsamp`:


~~~
summary(DSM_HARV, maxsamp = ncell(DSM_HARV))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
        HARV_dsmCrop
Min.          330.90
1st Qu.       361.52
Median        372.52
3rd Qu.       380.84
Max.          405.15
NA's            0.00
~~~
{: .output}

You may not see major differences in summary stats as `maxsamp` increases,
except with very large rasters.

To visualise this data in R using `ggplot2`, we need to convert it to a
dataframe.
The `raster` package has an built-in function for conversion to a plotable dataframe.


~~~
DSM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_HARV, xy = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now when we view the structure of our data, we will see a standard
dataframe format. We can apply `str` to view the structure of the new dataframe, `DSM_HARV_df`


~~~
str(DSM_HARV_df)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
'data.frame':	968044 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ x           : num  731454 731454 731456 731456 731458 ...
 $ y           : num  4713370 4713370 4713370 4713370 4713370 ...
 $ HARV_dsmCrop: num  370 371 371 362 370 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can use `ggplot()` to plot this data. We will set the color scale to `scale_fill_viridis_c`
which is a color-blindness friendly color scale. We will also use the `coord_quickmap()` function to use an approximate Mercator projection for our plots. This approximation is suitable for small areas that are not too close to the poles. Other coordinate systems are available in ggplot2 if needed, you can learn about them at their help page `?coord_map`.


~~~
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
    coord_quickmap()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="./fig/rmd-01-ggplot-raster-1.png" title="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale" alt="Raster plot with ggplot2 using the viridis color scale" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


This map shows the elevation of our study site in Harvard Forest. From the
legend, we can see that the maximum elevation is ~400, but we can't tell whether
this is 400 feet or 400 meters because the legend doesn't show us the units. We
can look at the metadata of our object to see what the units are. Much of the
metadata that we're interested in is part of the CRS..

Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what
meanings they have.

### View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in R
We can view the CRS string associated with our R object using the`crs()`
function.


~~~
crs(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
CRS arguments:
 +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
+towgs84=0,0,0 
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge
> What units are our data in?
>
> > ## Answers
> > `+units=m` tells us that our data is in meters.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Understanding CRS in Proj4 Format
The CRS for our data is given to us by R in `proj4` format. Let's break down
the pieces of `proj4` string. The string contains all of the individual CRS
elements that R or another GIS might need. Each element is specified with a
`+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by a `,`. After
each `+` we see the CRS element being defined. For example projection (`proj=`)
and datum (`datum=`).

### UTM Proj4 String
Our projection string for `DSM_HARV` specifies the UTM projection as follows:

`+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

* **proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **zone=18:** the zone is 18
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum is WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in meters
* **ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
the data is WGS84

Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRS's will have a
zone. Image source: Chrismurf at English Wikipedia, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#/media/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg) (CC-BY).

## Calculate Raster Min and Max Values

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. In this
case, given we are working with elevation data, these values represent the
min/max elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a GeoTIFF for us. We
can view these values:


~~~
minValue(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 330.9
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
maxValue(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 405.15
~~~
{: .output}

Since the minimum and maximum values haven't already been calculated, we can calculate them using the `setMinMax()` function.


~~~
DSM_HARV <- setMinMax(DSM_HARV)
minValue(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 330.9
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
maxValue(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 405.15
~~~
{: .output}


## Raster Bands
The Digital Surface Model object (`DSM_HARV`) that we've been working with is a
single band raster. This means that there is only one dataset stored in the
raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period.

![Multi-band raster image](../images/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png)

A raster dataset can contain one or more bands. We can use the `raster()`
function to import one single band from a single or multi-band raster. We can
view the number of bands in a raster using the `nlayers()` function.


~~~
nlayers(DSM_HARV)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}

However, raster data can also be multi-band, meaning that one raster file
contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. By
default the `raster()` function only imports the first band in a raster
regardless of whether it has one or more bands.


##Missing Data

The value that is conventionally used to take note of missing data (the
`NoDataValue` value) varies by the raster data type. For floating-point rasters,
the figure `-3.4e+38` is a common default, and for integers, `-9999` is
common. Some disciplines have specific conventions that vary from these
common values.

In some cases, other `NA` values may be more appropriate. An `NA` value should
be a) outside the range of valid values, and b) a value that fits the data type
in use. For instance, if your data ranges continuously from -20 to 100, 0 is
not an acceptable `NA` value! Or, for categories that number 1-15, 0 might be
fine for `NA`, but using -.000003 will force you to save the GeoTIFF on disk
as a floating point raster, resulting in a bigger file.

If we are lucky, our GeoTIFF file has a tag that tells us what is the
`NoDataValue`. If we are less lucky, we can find that information in the
raster's metadata. If a `NoDataValue` was stored in the GeoTIFF tag, when R
opens up the raster, it will assign each instance of the value to `NA`. Values
of `NA` will be ignored by R as demonstrated above.

## Create A Histogram of Raster Values

We can explore the distribution of values contained within our raster using the
`geom_histogram()` function which produces a histogram. Histograms are often
useful in identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data.


~~~
ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(data = DSM_HARV_df, aes(HARV_dsmCrop))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

<img src="./fig/rmd-01-view-raster-histogram-1.png" title="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram" alt="plot of chunk view-raster-histogram" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice that a warning message is thrown when R creates the histogram.

`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. We could pick a better bin value with the argument `binwidth`.
