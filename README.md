# R for Raster and Vector Data

This is a variant of the [Geospatial Data Carpentry Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/) [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R Lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) created at UW-Madison as part of video workshop series.

## Contributing to lesson development

* The lesson files to be edited are in the `_epiodes_rmd` folder. This repository uses the `master` branch for development.
* You can visualize the changes locally by typing `make serve` at your terminal. The site will be rendered at <http://localhost:4000>
* Each time you push a change to GitHub, Travis-CI rebuilds the lesson, and when it's successful (look for the green badge at the top of the README file), it publishes the result at <http://www.datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/>
* Note: any manual commit to `gh-pages` will be erased and lost during the automated build and deploy cycle operated by Travis-CI.
